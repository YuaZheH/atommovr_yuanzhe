class ErrorModel:
    """
    Generic object for modelling error processes during rearrangement.
    (e.g. atom loss due to vacuum collisions or heating from tweezers,
    failure to pick up or put down atoms in tweezer handoff, etc.). 
    
    Takes as input an AtomArray object representing the current state
    of the array and containing information about physical parameters
    (such as AOD move speed, vacuum-limited lifetime), and a list of 
    Move objects representing moves to execute.
     
    Returns as output the modified AtomArray object after the moves 
    have been applied, and two flags, MoveFailureFlag and AtomLossFlag,
    which indicate if any moves have failed or if any atoms have been
    lost, respectively.
    
    ## Parameters:
    putdown_time : float, optional (default = 0)
        the time it takes to set atoms down, in s.
    pickup_time : float, optional (default = 0)
        the time it takes to pick atoms up, in s.

        Given a set of moves and the current state, assigns
        an attribute `failure_flag` to the move. 
        - If the move suceeds, `move_failure_flag = 0`.
        - If the move fails but the atom remains in its original position,
        `move.failure_flag = 1`.
        - If the move fails and the atom is also ejected,
        `move.failure_flag = 2`.

        ## Parameters
        state : np.ndarray
            the current state of the array that the moves are being applied to.
        moves : list[Move]
            the moves to be executed on the state in parallel.

        moves_w_flags : list[Move]
            a list of the same moves, but where each move now has an attribute
